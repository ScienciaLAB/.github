# ScienciaLAB

ScienciaLAB is a research-driven technology company specializing in scientific document engineering, artificial intelligence, and open science.  
We maintain and develop advanced tools open-source to extract, structure, and analyze scientific knowledge from raw documents like PDFs, enabling deeper insights and data accessibility.

## üõ†Ô∏è Main projects

### **GROBID**

GROBID (GeneRation Of BIbliographic Data) is an open-source tool designed to parse and extract structured information from scientific documents.  
It utilizes machine learning techniques to convert raw PDFs into machine-readable formats, enabling efficient text mining and corpus analysis.

- **Key Features**:
  - Extracts bibliographic metadata (e.g., title, authors, affiliations, abstracts) with high accuracy.
  - Structures document bodies into XML-TEI format, preserving sections, citations, figures, and tables.
  - Aligns extracted structures with the original PDF layout for dynamic annotations.

### **GROBID-Quantities**

An extension of GROBID, this tool focuses on recognizing and normalizing physical quantities and measurements in scientific texts.  
It supports over 120 base units and can identify substances associated with measurements, facilitating data extraction in STEM fields.

### **Material-Mentions**

Building upon GROBID-Quantities, Material-Mentions specializes in extracting mentions of materials and their properties from scientific literature.  
Initially focused on superconductors, it identifies chemical formulas, sample types, and associated properties, aiding in materials science research.

### **Document-QA**

Document-QA is an experimental question-answering system that allows users to interact with scientific documents using natural language queries.  
It combines document parsing, embedding generation, and retrieval-based QA to support contextual document exploration.

### **Streamlit-PDF-Viewer**

A lightweight and user-friendly Streamlit app to visualize and annotate scientific PDF documents.  
Useful for testing GROBID or QA pipelines, it helps teams interactively inspect extraction results and data quality.

## üî¨ Research

ScienciaLAB contributes to the open science and NLP communities through applied research in:

- Information extraction from scientific literature
- Machine learning for document layout understanding
- Semantic search and QA over scientific corpora
- Materials science text mining (e.g., superconductors, phase transitions)

We actively collaborate with academic institutions aligned with open research values.
